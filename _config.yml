  I am a software engineer. I really enjoy building solid mobile apps with fantastic user 
  experiences. I also like analyzing and connecting data, and working with maps. Outside of 
  computers, I love pushing myself through distance running and hiking. I also enjoy
  cooking and trying new food. Right now, I'm working at Very Good Ventures, spending my time 
  building Flutter apps and learning all I can from the talented team I get to work with.
